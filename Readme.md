#  Build a Multilayer Perceptron using C#

## About this code
This is a Visual Studio 2017 solution comprising of a reusable implementation of Multilayer Perceptron. The code has been compiled for compatibility with .NET 4.6 and .NET Core 2.0

## Training algorithms implemented
1. Stochastic gradient descent
2. Batch gradient descent

## Perceptron
This is a class library that implements a simple multi-layer perceptron

## Book/AdalineTraining
Demonstrates Widrow-Hoff learning algorithm

## Book/GradientDescent
Demonstrates the principles of gradient descent by trying to find the minima of a parabolic curve

## Book/SimplePerceptronTraining
Demonstrates the the very fundamental learning principles behind Rosenblatt's perceptron using the SGN() activation function
