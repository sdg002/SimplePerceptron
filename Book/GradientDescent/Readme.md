**About**

Demonstrates the working of the Gradient Descent algorithm to find the minima of a parabolic curve

**Equation of the parabola**

y=(x-5)*(x-5) + 1.0

**How to run?**

Launch Powershell ISE and open the file GradientDescent.ps1
Start the script. You will be prompted for learning rate and epochs.

**How to view the results?**

The progress is logged on the console and in the file *LearningCurve.log* which can be visualized through GNUPLOT
Gnuplot file  *GnuPlotGradientDescentProgress.plt* shows the descent towards the minima
Gnuplot file *GnuPlotShowFunction.plt* shows just the parabolic curve
