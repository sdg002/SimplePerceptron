This project contains PowerShell scripts and supporting files that were used for explaining the basic concepts of Perceptrons


**AdalineTraining** - Demonstrates Widrow-Hoff learning algorithm

**SimplePerceptronTraining** - Demonstrates the the very fundamental learning principles behind Rosenblatt's perceptron using the SGN() activation function

**GradientDescent** - Demonstrates the principles of gradient descent by trying to find the minima of a parabolic curve
