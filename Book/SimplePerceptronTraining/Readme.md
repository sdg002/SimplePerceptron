**About**

This folder contains a single PowerShell script Training.ps1
This script demonstrates how to train Rosenblatt's perceptron.
There are 2 sets of data files
	LinearlySeparable
	Non-linearlySeparable

These folders contain the data points for training. They are nearly identical but for an additional point in the non-liner folder

**How to run the script?**

Open the file Training.ps1 in *PowerShell ISE* 
Press F5 to start the script and follow instructions.
Depending on your choice of *linearly-separable* or *inseparable*, the outputs will be directed to the folders *LinearlySeparable* and *Not-LinearlySeparable* respectively

**What is the outcome?**

When you chose the option *linearly-separable* option, there is a nice convergence in less than 5 epochs
When you chose the option *not-linearly-separable* there is never a convergence. The learning curve exhibits an oscillatory behaviour
